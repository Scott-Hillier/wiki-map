# Git merge steps from Andy's lecture

* If branch created previously, switch to branch:
`> git checkout feature/new-branch`
* Create new branch and switch to it:
`> git checkout -b feature/new-branch`
`> git branch` (to confirm on branch)

* Add files and commit:
`> git add .`
`> git commit -m "commit message"`

* Push branch to cloud:
`> git push origin feature/new-branch` (now it's in the cloud)

* Open pull request on github repo page (request to merge changes)
  * Create pull request
    * At this step, anyone on team can review files that were changed
  * Merge pull request > create a merge commit > confirm merge
